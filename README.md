## The Carbon Credit Tokenization Platform on Solana

The Carbon Credit Tokenization Platform on Solana is a decentralized application (dApp) that tokenizes certified carbon credits on-chain using the Token Extensions Standard 2022 for enhanced functionality. This standard enables advanced features like transfer hooks, metadata integration, and programmable restrictions, ensuring secure, verifiable, and transparent trading and retirement of carbon credits. Built on Solana’s high-speed, low-cost blockchain, the platform offers scalable, eco-friendly management of carbon offsets, fostering global accessibility and trust in sustainable practices.
